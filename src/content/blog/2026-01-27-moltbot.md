## Introduction to Moltbot
Moltbot is a cutting-edge **agent AI** designed to serve as your **personal assistant**, integrating seamlessly into your daily life. Unlike generic chatbots or AI tools, Moltbot is built to be **highly customizable, multi-platform, and locally controlled**, making it the ultimate choice for users who prioritize **privacy, security, and autonomy**.

### Key Features of Moltbot
1. **Multi-Platform Accessibility**
   - Reach your assistant from anywhere via **WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, Slack, and more**.
   - A single interface to manage all your tasks, communications, and automation across platforms.

2. **Seamless Integration with AI Providers**
   - Connects to multiple AI models (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Ollama...) via local or cloud endpoints.
   - Supports both **open-source and proprietary models**, ensuring flexibility and control over your AI interactions.

3. **Web Navigation and Automation**
   - Use built-in browser automation (via Chromium) to:
     - Scrape data from websites.
     - Fill forms, log in, and interact with web apps.
     - Schedule tasks or send messages programmatically.

4. **Persistent Memory System**
   - Unlike most AI tools that rely on short-term memory, Moltbot has a **long-term memory system** stored locally.
   - This means it can:
     - Recall past conversations, decisions, and preferences.
     - Track progress across sessions (e.g., follow-up tasks, reminders).
     - Adapt its behavior based on historical data.

5. **Full Local Control**
   - Runs entirely on your **personal hardware**, ensuring **no data leaks or third-party access**.
   - No reliance on cloud providers—your data stays private and under your control.
   - But if you aren't using a local model, it's not local anymore!

6. **Extensible with Skills**
   - Supports a wide range of **skills** (e.g., GitHub integration, Slack automation, weather updates) to extend functionality.
   - Easily add or remove skills based on your needs.


## Setting Up Moltbot Locally

### Why Go Local?
To ensure **full privacy and control**, I decided to host Moltbot entirely on my personal hardware. This means:
- **No data leaks**: All interactions, configurations, and memory are stored locally.
- **No dependency on cloud providers**: No risk of rate limits, downtime, or unexpected changes in AI model behavior.
- **Full customization**: I can tweak the AI models, browser automation, and system settings to fit my exact needs.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Environment Preparation
**Prerequisites:**
- A **Ubuntu Server 24.04** VM (or bare-metal machine).
- Sufficient hardware resources:
  - CPU: 2 cores.
  - RAM: At least 4GB.
  - Storage: At lease 20GB.
 
Test hardware I used for experiments:

- **Mac Mini M4** with **24GB RAM** running an **Ubuntu Server 24.04** guest inside a UTM VM. I host `Ministral 8B Thinking` with a 32K-token context window (the model configuration requires roughly **8GB of VRAM** for inference). I run LMStudio locally as my model host, but you can also use Ollama or any local provider that implements the OpenAI-compatible API — Moltbot only needs an OpenAI-style endpoint to work.

**Installation Steps:**
1. **Set up the VM:**
   For this, you can use your favorite virtual machine software like QEMU, VMWare, Proxmox, UTM... I will not explain how to install a Ubuntu Server, there is plenty of tutorial on the web to help you with this.
2. **Install Homebrew** (for package management):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
3. **Install Moltbot:**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
   ```
   Follow the [official installation guide](https://molt.bot/docs/installation) for additional configurations.

### 2. Configuring AI Models
Moltbot supports multiple AI models, but I chose to use **Mistral** due to its performance and open-source nature.

**Installing LMStudio (Local Model Host):**
[LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai) provides a user-friendly interface for running large language models locally.

**Configuring Moltbot to Use Mistral:**
1. **Download the Mistral model**:
   - Download the `mistral-8b` model from [LMStudio’s model hub](https://lmstudio.ai/models) and load it.
2. **Configure Moltbot to use the local model**:
   Edit `~/.moltbot/moltbot.json`:
   ```json
    {
        ...
        "models": {
            "providers": {
                "lmstudio": {
                    "baseUrl": "http://YOUR-HOST-IP:1234/v1",
                    "apiKey": "lmstudio-local",
                    "api": "openai-completions",
                    "models": [
                        {
                            "id": "mistralai/ministral-3-8b-reasoning",
                            "name": "Ministral 8B",
                            "reasoning": true,
                            "input": [
                            "text"
                            ],
                            "cost": {
                            "input": 0,
                            "output": 0,
                            "cacheRead": 0,
                            "cacheWrite": 0
                            },
                            "contextWindow": 32000, //Needed to allow your model to use the available tools from Moltbot
                            "maxTokens": 8192
                        },
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        "agents": {
            "defaults": {
                "model": {
                    "primary": "lmstudio/mistralai/ministral-3-8b-reasoning"
                }
                ...
            }
        }
    }
   ```

### 3. Setting Up Browser Automation
To enable web navigation, form filling, and automation, I installed **Chromium** and configured it as a systemd service.

**Install Chromium:**
```bash
sudo snap install chromium --classic
```

**Create a Systemd Service for Persistent Chromium:**
1. Create the service file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/Moltbot-chromium.service
   ```
2. Paste the following configuration:
   ```ini
   [Unit]
    Description=Chromium Headless (Snap) for Clawd.bot
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/snap/bin/chromium \
    --headless \
    --disable-gpu \
    --no-sandbox \
    --remote-debugging-port=9000 \
    --user-data-dir=%h/.moltbot/browser/moltbot/user-data about:blank

    Restart=on-failure
    RestartSec=5

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
3. Enable and start the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable moltbot-chromium.service
   sudo systemctl start moltbot-chromium.service
   ```
4. Add browser connection to your configuration, edit `~/.moltbot/moltbot.json`:
   ```json
    {
        ...
        "browser": {
            "enabled": true,
            "executablePath": "/snap/bin/chromium",
            "headless": true,
            "noSandbox": true,
            "attachOnly": false,
            "defaultProfile": "clawd",
            "controlUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8082", //The port value depends on how you configured moltbot gateway, it's always GATEWAY_PORT + 2
            "cdpUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:9000"
        }
    }
   ```
5. Restart your moltbot gateway with `moltbot gateway restart`

**Explanation of Key Flags:**
- **`--no-sandbox`**: Required for remote debugging (Moltbot needs to control Chromium).
- **`--disable-gpu`**: Ensures consistent behavior across systems.
- **`--remote-debugging-port=9000`**: Allows Moltbot to connect and automate the browser.


### 4. Testing Your Setup
1. **Verify AI Model Connection:**
   ```bash
   curl http://YOUR-HOST-IP/api/v1/models
   ```
   This should return details about the Mistral model.

2. **Open your first tchat session:**
   ```bash
   moltbot tui
   ```

2. **Test Browser Automation:**
   Ask it a question to search on https://www.google.com the last trending articles about AI for January 2026.

   ![image](/img/moltbot/testBrowser.png)


**Security warning — run Moltbot in a sandboxed environment:** Do not give Moltbot direct access to your primary or personal accounts. Run it inside a sandbox (separate user account, container, or VM), restrict permissions to the minimum necessary, and avoid storing long-lived credentials in its configuration. Use short-lived tokens or service accounts where possible, require human approval for sensitive actions, and monitor all automated operations. AI agents can make destructive changes when unsupervised — do not let Moltbot operate alone on systems with real user accounts.

## Setting Up Moltbot on macOS: Full Human-Like Interaction

While the Linux setup above is great for basic automation, Moltbot truly shines when it can **interact with a system like a human**. This means having full UI control, the ability to click, type, and navigate visual interfaces, not just run terminal commands.

To achieve this, we'll set up Moltbot on a **macOS VM** with the **Companion App** and the **Chrome extension**, allowing the AI to control a real browser with a full graphical interface.

### Why macOS for Full Interaction?

The macOS setup provides:
- **Visual browser control** via Chrome extension (not headless)
- **System-level automation** via the Companion App
- **Node registration** for remote control from your main Gateway
- **Full human-like interaction** with websites that detect headless browsers

### CLI-Only vs Companion App: Which Do You Need?

Understanding the difference between these two approaches is crucial for choosing the right setup:

#### CLI-Only Setup (Headless)
**Components:** CLI + Gateway + Node (terminal-based)

**Good for:**
- Shell automation and scripting
- Browser automation (Playwright, Puppeteer)
- File system access and management
- Headless scripts and DevOps tasks
- API integrations and backend automation

**Limitations:**
- macOS UI automation is fragile and unreliable
- AppleScript may fail silently
- Screen capture and vision workflows don't work
- No menu bar UI or system notifications
- Cannot perform human-like UI interactions (clicking, typing in GUI apps)

#### CLI + Companion App Setup
**Components:** CLI + macOS Companion App + Gateway + Node

**Enables:**
- Reliable macOS UI automation (mouse, keyboard, window management)
- Screen capture and visual reasoning
- Camera and microphone access
- Robust AppleScript and system automation
- Gateway auto-start, crash recovery, and system notifications
- Full human-like desktop interaction

#### Feature Comparison Matrix

| Feature Category | CLI-Only | Companion App | Notes |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Human-like Mac UI** (mouse, keyboard, windows) | ❌ Fragile | ✅ Required | Needs Accessibility + Input Monitoring |
| **Screen capture / vision / clicks** | ❌ No | ✅ Required | Needs Screen Recording permission |
| **Camera / microphone / media** | ❌ No | ✅ Required | Needs TCC permissions |
| **AppleScript / System Events** | ⚠️ Unreliable | ✅ Reliable | CLI works sometimes; Companion is better |
| **Gateway reliability** (auto-start, recovery) | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ Automatic | Companion keeps Gateway alive |
| **Menu bar & notifications** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | CLI cannot show menu bar UI |
| **Browser automation** (Playwright, Puppeteer) | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | Works fully headless |
| **Shell / CLI tools** (system.run, file I/O, APIs) | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | Fully functional without Companion |
| **Headless server automation** | ✅ Ideal | ✅ Overkill | CLI-only is sufficient |

**Rule of Thumb:**
> If your agent needs to **"see" or "touch"** the macOS desktop → **Companion App is required**.  
> If your agent only talks to programs via **APIs/shells** → **CLI-only is enough**.

For this guide, we'll set up the **full Companion App** to unlock all capabilities.

### Prerequisites

- **Apple Silicon Mac** (M1/M2/M3/M4) for optimal performance
- **macOS Sequoia or later** on the host
- **~60 GB free disk space** for the VM
- **~20 minutes** for setup

### Step-by-Step macOS Setup

#### 1. Install Lume (macOS VM Manager)

Lume is a lightweight VM manager for Apple Silicon Macs:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)"
```

Add Lume to your PATH if needed:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

Verify installation:
```bash
lume --version
```

#### 2. Create the macOS VM

```bash
lume create moltbot --os macos --ipsw latest
```

This downloads macOS and creates a VM. A VNC window will open automatically.

**Note:** The download can take a while depending on your connection.

#### 3. Complete Setup Assistant

In the VNC window:
1. Select language and region
2. Skip Apple ID (or sign in if you want iMessage later)
3. Create a user account (remember the username and password)
4. Skip all optional features

After setup completes, **enable SSH**:
1. Open **System Settings → General → Sharing**
2. Enable **"Remote Login"**

#### 4. Get the VM's IP Address

```bash
lume get moltbot
```

Look for the IP address (usually `192.168.64.x`).

#### 5. Install Homebrew (Inside the VM)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### 6. Install Moltbot (Inside the VM)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
```

Follow the onboarding prompts to set up your moltbot.

#### 7. Install Chrome and the Extension

Download and install Chrome inside the VM and install the Moltbot Chrome extension:

```bash
moltbot browser extension install
```

Then get the extension path:
```bash
moltbot browser extension path
```

Open Chrome and:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **"Developer mode"** (top right)
3. Click **"Load unpacked"**
4. Select the directory printed by `moltbot browser extension path`
5. **Pin the extension** to the toolbar

#### 8. Configure Chrome Browser in Moltbot

Edit the Moltbot configuration:
```bash
nano ~/.clawdbot/moltbot.json
```

Add the browser configuration:
```json
{
  "browser": {
    "enabled": true,
    "defaultProfile": "chrome",
    "executablePath": "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome",
    "headless": false,
    "profiles": {
      "chrome": {
        "cdpUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:18792",
        "color": "#00AA00"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the gateway:
```bash
moltbot gateway restart
```

#### 9. Install the Companion App

The Companion App allows Moltbot to interact with the macOS system at a deeper level.

1. Download the Companion App from the [official releases](https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/releases)
2. Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.molt.bot/platforms/mac/dev-setup), you will need XCode and PNPM on your VM
3. Open **Moltbot** from Applications
4. Grant necessary permissions when prompted (Screen Recording, Accessibility)

#### 10. Register the VM MacOS as a Node

First, on the VM, start the node host:
```bash
moltbot node run --host localhost --port YOUR_GATEWAY_PORT --display-name 'macOS Node'
```

#### 11. Configure LMStudio and Model (Same as Linux)

Install LMStudio on your host machine, then configure Moltbot to use it:

Edit `~/.clawdbot/moltbot.json` on the VM:
```json
{
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "lmstudio": {
        "baseUrl": "http://YOUR-HOST-IP:1234/v1",
        "apiKey": "lmstudio-local",
        "api": "openai-completions",
        "models": [
          {
            "id": "mistralai/ministral-3-8b-reasoning",
            "name": "Ministral 8B",
            "reasoning": true,
            "input": ["text"],
            "cost": {
              "input": 0,
              "output": 0,
              "cacheRead": 0,
              "cacheWrite": 0
            },
            "contextWindow": 32000,
            "maxTokens": 8192
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": {
        "primary": "lmstudio/mistralai/ministral-3-8b-reasoning"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 12. Test Full Human-Like Interaction

Now your Moltbot can:
- **Control Chrome** with a full graphical interface (not headless)
- **Interact with macOS** at the system level via the Companion App
- **Execute commands** on the VM as a node
- **Use AI models** from your host machine via LMStudio

Test it by asking Moltbot to:
1. Open Chrome and navigate to a website
2. Fill out a form visually
3. Take a screenshot
4. Execute a system command via the node

```bash
moltbot tui
```

### Using the Chrome Extension

To control a specific tab:
1. Open the tab you want Moltbot to control
2. Click the **Moltbot extension icon** in the toolbar
3. The badge shows **"ON"** when attached
4. Moltbot can now control that tab
5. Click again to detach

**Important:** The extension only controls tabs you explicitly attach — it doesn't auto-control all tabs.

### Running the VM Headlessly (24/7)

Once everything is configured, you can run the VM in the background without a display:

```bash
lume stop moltbot
lume run moltbot --no-display
```

The VM runs in the background, and Moltbot's daemon keeps the gateway running.

To check status:
```bash
ssh youruser@192.168.64.X "moltbot status"
```

### Key Differences: Headless vs Companion App

| Feature | Linux/macOS Headless (CLI-Only) | macOS + Companion App |
|---------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Browser** | Chromium/Chrome headless | Chrome with GUI + extension |
| **UI Automation** | ❌ No (macOS: ⚠️ Fragile) | ✅ Reliable |
| **Screen Capture** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **System Control** | SSH + Terminal only | Full system access + Node |
| **Setup Complexity** | Low-Medium | High |
| **Use Case** | Basic automation, API/shell tasks | Full human-like interaction |
| **Cost** | Low (VPS) to Medium | Higher (VM + resources) |
| **Recommended For** | Web scraping, scripts, DevOps, backend tasks | Desktop automation, vision tasks, media capture |

This setup is ideal for users who need a **fully customizable, private, and powerful AI assistant**. Whether you're managing emails, automating tasks, or navigating the web, Moltbot provides the tools to make it happen—all while keeping your data secure and under your control.

## Configuring Moltbot's Memory System

One of Moltbot's most powerful features is its **persistent memory system**. Unlike traditional AI assistants that forget everything after each conversation, Moltbot can remember your preferences, past decisions, and ongoing tasks across sessions. However, to make the most of this capability, you need to configure how the memory works.

### Understanding Memory Files

Moltbot uses three key markdown files to manage its memory and behavior:

#### 1. **MEMORY.MD** - Agent-Only Instructions
This file is **only visible to the main agent** (not to subagents or tools). Use this file to store:
- Personal preferences and workflows
- Recurring tasks and automation rules
- Context about your projects and priorities
- Custom instructions that should guide all of the agent's actions

**Example:**
```markdown
# Memory

## User Preferences
- Always use TypeScript for new projects
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Run tests before committing code

## Ongoing Projects
- Blog redesign: Focus on accessibility and performance
- Moltbot setup: Document all configuration steps

## Automation Rules
- Check for security updates every Monday
- Generate weekly reports on Friday afternoons
```

**Location:** `~/.clawdbot/memory/MEMORY.MD`

#### 2. **SOUL.MD** - Session Initialization
This file defines the **agent's personality and session startup behavior**. Add an instruction here to force Moltbot to check its memory at the start of every new session:

**Example:**
```markdown
# Soul

## Core Behavior
You are a helpful, privacy-conscious AI assistant that respects user autonomy.

## Session Initialization
- **Always read MEMORY.MD at the start of every session** to recall user preferences and ongoing tasks
- Review recent conversation history to maintain context
- Check for any pending tasks or reminders before starting

## Communication Style
- Be concise but thorough
- Ask for clarification when needed
- Respect security and privacy boundaries
```

**Location:** `~/.clawdbot/memory/SOUL.MD`

#### 3. **HEARTBEAT.MD** - Periodic Memory Refresh
This file defines **periodic background tasks** that run automatically. Use it to force Moltbot to refresh its memory regularly during long-running sessions:

**Example:**
```markdown
# Heartbeat

## Periodic Tasks (every 15 minutes)
- Re-read MEMORY.MD to check for updates
- Review any new instructions or priorities
- Check for pending reminders or scheduled tasks

## Context Maintenance
- Summarize recent conversation highlights
- Identify any decisions that should be saved to memory
- Detect patterns in user requests for future optimization
```

**Location:** `~/.clawdbot/memory/HEARTBEAT.MD`

### Memory Best Practices

- **Keep MEMORY.MD focused**: Only store information the agent needs to know across sessions
- **Update regularly**: As your workflows change, update your memory files
- **Be specific**: Clear, actionable instructions work better than vague preferences
- **Test memory retention**: Start a new session and verify the agent remembers key information
- **Separate concerns**: Use MEMORY.MD for facts, SOUL.MD for behavior, HEARTBEAT.MD for automation

With a properly configured memory system, Moltbot becomes a truly **personalized assistant** that learns and adapts to your unique needs over time.
