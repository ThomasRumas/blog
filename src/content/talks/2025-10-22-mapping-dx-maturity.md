Join Julien Roynette and Thomas Rumas, developer experience leaders at ADEO, as they outline their organisation’s developer experience evolution — from understanding tech stacks and streamlining onboarding to leveraging a unified internal DevHub and fostering a collaborative engineering culture. This session will feature a demonstration and explore how they’re able to deliver a more seamless and empowering developer journey though:

* Mapping the DX maturity journey by deeply understanding developer needs, stacks, and behaviours.
* Centralising tool visibility and onboarding through platforms like DevHub to streamline the developer experience.
* Building internal communities that foster collaboration, observability ownership, and shared problem-solving.
* Gathering continuous feedback through structured campaigns to guide ongoing improvements.

During the presentation, we did a live demo of our homemade solution to onboard people inside ADEO.
